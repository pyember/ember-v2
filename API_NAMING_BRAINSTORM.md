# Alternative Names for `models.bind()`

## The Current Problem
`models.bind("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)` - "bind" is a technical term that doesn't convey intent

## What It Actually Does
Creates a reusable model instance with preset parameters

## 10 Alternative Names

### 1. `models.create()`
```python
gpt4 = models.create("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
```
**Pros**: Simple, clear that you're creating something
**Cons**: Too generic, doesn't convey the reusability aspect

### 2. `models.configure()`
```python
gpt4 = models.configure("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
```
**Pros**: Clear that you're setting configuration
**Cons**: Sounds like you're configuring the model itself, not creating an instance

### 3. `models.with_params()`
```python
gpt4 = models.with_params("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
```
**Pros**: Explicit about what you're doing
**Cons**: Verbose, not elegant

### 4. `models.preset()`
```python
gpt4 = models.preset("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
```
**Pros**: Conveys that you're presetting parameters
**Cons**: Might sound like you're modifying global state

### 5. `models.setup()`
```python
gpt4 = models.setup("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
```
**Pros**: Simple, implies preparation for use
**Cons**: Could be confused with initialization

### 6. `models.prepare()`
```python
gpt4 = models.prepare("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
```
**Pros**: Natural language, implies getting ready for use
**Cons**: Slightly verbose

### 7. `models.instance()`
```python
gpt4 = models.instance("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
```
**Pros**: Technical users understand you're creating an instance
**Cons**: Too technical, OOP jargon

### 8. `models.get()`
```python
gpt4 = models.get("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
```
**Pros**: Super simple, mirrors dict.get()
**Cons**: Doesn't convey that you're creating something new

### 9. `models.use()`
```python
gpt4 = models.use("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
```
**Pros**: Natural, implies you'll use this configuration
**Cons**: Might be confused with immediate invocation

### 10. `models.model()`
```python
gpt4 = models.model("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
```
**Pros**: Clear you're getting a model, follows pattern like `Path.path()`
**Cons**: Repetitive with the module name

## Jeff Dean's Analysis
Looking at usage patterns, we want something that:
1. Makes it clear you're creating a reusable thing
2. Differentiates from direct invocation `models("gpt-4", prompt)`
3. Is short and memorable

## Sanjay's Performance Note
Whatever we choose, it should suggest that this is more efficient than repeated direct calls:
```python
# Less efficient
for prompt in prompts:
    response = models("gpt-4", prompt, temperature=0.7)

# More efficient  
gpt4 = models.???("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
for prompt in prompts:
    response = gpt4(prompt)
```

## Uncle Bob's Clarity Principle
The name should make the code read like well-written prose:
- "Create a gpt4 model with temperature 0.7"
- "Get a gpt4 model with temperature 0.7"
- "Prepare a gpt4 model with temperature 0.7"

## Steve Jobs' Verdict
"I like `create`. It's simple. Everyone knows what create means. But `get` is even simpler - it's what people already say: 'get me the GPT-4 model with these settings.'"

## Jony Ive's Aesthetic
"The most elegant would be if we didn't need a method at all. What if `models["gpt-4"]` returned a configurable object? But given we need parameters, `get` feels most natural."

## Additional Consideration: Overloading

What if we didn't need a separate method at all?

```python
# Current: two different methods
response = models("gpt-4", "prompt")  # Direct call
gpt4 = models.bind("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)  # Create binding

# Proposed: smart detection
response = models("gpt-4", "prompt")  # Has prompt -> returns response
gpt4 = models("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)  # No prompt -> returns callable
```

**Jeff Dean**: "Clever, but too clever. Explicit is better."

## Final Recommendation

After channeling these masters:

**Winner: `models.get()`**
```python
gpt4 = models.get("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
response = gpt4("What is the meaning of life?")
```

Why:
1. **Shortest possible** (3 letters)
2. **Universally understood** - everyone knows get
3. **Familiar pattern** - dict.get(), getattr(), etc.
4. **Natural speech** - "get me the GPT-4 model"
5. **No ambiguity** - clearly different from direct invocation

**Steve Jobs**: "Get. It's perfect. Ship it."

**Jony Ive**: "The beauty is in its invisibility. 'Get' doesn't make you think."

**Uncle Bob**: "And it's honest. You're getting a configured model instance."
