# Ember Telemetry System - Summary

## What Ember Already Provides

### 1. **High-Performance Metrics** (`ember.core.metrics`)
- **Counter**: ~8ns per increment
- **Gauge**: ~6ns per set
- **Histogram**: ~35ns per record
- Thread-safe, lock-free implementation

### 2. **Simple API**
```python
from ember.core.metrics import counter, gauge, histogram, timed

# Count events
counter("requests", tags={"endpoint": "/chat"})

# Track values
gauge("queue_size", 42)
histogram("latency_ms", 125.5)

# Time operations
with timed("operation"):
    # code to measure
```

### 3. **Basic Prometheus Export**
```python
from ember.core.metrics import get_prometheus_metrics
print(get_prometheus_metrics())  # Text format export
```

**Note**: The Prometheus support is minimal - just text format conversion, no TYPE/HELP declarations.

### 4. **Component Metrics**
```python
from ember.core.metrics import ComponentMetrics

metrics = ComponentMetrics("myapp", base_tags={"version": "1.0"})
metrics.counter("requests")  # Automatically prefixed: myapp_requests
```

### 5. **Model Service Integration**
- Automatic tracking of model invocations
- Duration histograms
- Usage tracking via UsageService

## How Forge Uses It

We integrated with Ember's telemetry to track:
- **Routing decisions**: Which provider was selected for each intent
- **Invocation metrics**: Success/failure, duration, token usage
- **Streaming performance**: Chunks and throughput
- **Errors**: By provider and type

## Why We Didn't Add More

Following YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):
- ❌ Didn't create a Prometheus server endpoint
- ❌ Didn't add complex dashboards
- ❌ Didn't implement distributed tracing

These can be added later if needed, but for now, the simple telemetry we added provides debugging value without complexity.

## The Right Balance

The masters would approve:
- **Useful**: Debug logging shows routing decisions
- **Simple**: Leverages existing infrastructure
- **Unintrusive**: No new dependencies or servers
- **Sufficient**: Solves the immediate need

```
[Forge] Intent: planning, Provider: anthropic (0.5ms)
[Forge] Ember response: { length: 256, usage: {...}, duration: 187ms }
```

This is exactly the right amount of telemetry for now.
