# Deeper Analysis: The Perfect Method Name

## What Are We Actually Doing?

When someone writes:
```python
gpt4 = models.???(""gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
```

They are:
1. **Creating** a new callable object
2. **Configuring** it with specific parameters
3. **Preparing** it for repeated use
4. **Specializing** a general model for a specific use case

## The Linguistic Test

What would someone say in natural conversation?

- "I need to **get** GPT-4 with temperature 0.7" ❌ (sounds like retrieval)
- "I need to **bind** GPT-4 with temperature 0.7" ❌ (too technical)
- "I need to **create** a GPT-4 with temperature 0.7" ✓ (but generic)
- "I need to **configure** GPT-4 with temperature 0.7" ✓ (clear intent)
- "I need to **use** GPT-4 with temperature 0.7" ✓✓ (most natural)
- "I need GPT-4 **with** temperature 0.7" ✓✓✓ (perfect!)

## The Revelation: `with`

```python
# This reads like English!
gpt4 = models.with("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
creative_gpt4 = models.with("gpt-4", temperature=0.9, max_tokens=1000)
```

Why `with` is perfect:
1. **Shortest contextual word** (4 letters)
2. **Reads naturally**: "models with gpt-4 temperature 0.7"
3. **Implies configuration**: "with these settings"
4. **Familiar from Python**: `with open()`, `with context:`
5. **Clear distinction** from direct call

## Wait... Even Better?

What if we follow Python's pattern more closely?

```python
# Python's open()
f = open("file.txt", "r")

# Could we do:
gpt4 = models.open("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
```

No, that implies a connection/resource.

## Another Angle: What Would Guido Do?

Python uses different patterns:
- `dict()` or `dict.fromkeys()` - creation
- `partial()` - partial application
- `property()` - configuration

What about:
```python
gpt4 = models.partial("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
```

Too technical.

## The Final Showdown

### `models.with()`
```python
gpt4 = models.with("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
```
- ✓ Natural English
- ✓ Short
- ✓ Clear intent
- ✓ Pythonic feel

### `models.using()`
```python
gpt4 = models.using("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
```
- ✓ Natural English
- ✓ Action-oriented
- ✗ Slightly longer
- ✓ Very clear

### `models.configure()`
```python
gpt4 = models.configure("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)
```
- ✓ Explicit
- ✗ Verbose
- ✓ Technical users love it
- ✗ Steve Jobs would hate it

## Jeff Dean's Insight

"Look at the usage pattern in a real codebase:"

```python
# Pattern 1: One-off calls
response = models("gpt-4", "Hello world")

# Pattern 2: Repeated calls with same config
analyzer = models.with("gpt-4", temperature=0.2)  # Low temp for analysis
creative = models.with("gpt-4", temperature=0.9)  # High temp for creativity

for doc in documents:
    analysis = analyzer(f"Analyze: {doc}")
    story = creative(f"Write a story about: {doc}")
```

The word `with` creates a clear mental model: "a model WITH these settings"

## Steve Jobs' Final Test

"Read it out loud:"
- "models dot bind" - What?
- "models dot get" - Get what? From where?
- "models dot with" - With what? Oh, with these settings. Perfect.

## Uncle Bob's Approval

"The code should read like well-written prose:"
```python
# This reads like a sentence
assistant = models.with("claude-3", temperature=0.7, max_tokens=2000)
response = assistant("How do I implement a binary search?")
```

## The Winner: `models.with()`

It's not just better than `bind` - it might be the perfect name:
1. Natural English
2. Minimal cognitive load
3. Clear intent
4. Pythonic
5. Steve Jobs would smile

## But Wait... One More Idea

**The Radical Simplification**

What if we made the API even MORE elegant by removing the string quotes?

```python
# Current
gpt4 = models.with("gpt-4", temperature=0.7)

# What if models had dynamic attributes?
gpt4 = models.gpt4.with(temperature=0.7)

# Or even
gpt4 = models.gpt4(temperature=0.7)
```

But this has problems:
- Not discoverable (can't see available models)
- Doesn't work with dynamic model names
- Too much magic

## Final Decision: `models.with()`

After exploring every possibility, `with` remains the best choice:

```python
# Beautiful, clear, natural
assistant = models.with("claude-3-opus", temperature=0.7)
analyzer = models.with("gpt-4", temperature=0.2)
creative = models.with("gpt-4", temperature=0.9)

# Versus the current confusion
assistant = models.bind("claude-3-opus", temperature=0.7)  # What does bind mean?
```

**Steve Jobs**: "When you've found the right word, you know it. It's 'with'."

**Jony Ive**: "The beauty is that 'with' disappears. You don't think about the method, you think about what you're doing."

**Jeff Dean**: "And it's efficient to type. Four letters, no cognitive overhead."

**Uncle Bob**: "The code reads like a specification: 'I want models with these parameters.'"
