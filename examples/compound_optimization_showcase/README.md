## Architecture

### Expert Models (ModelCall Operators)

The system employs three specialized expert models as ModelCall operators:

1. **Reasoning Expert (`o1-mini`)** - Deep analytical reasoning for complex questions
2. **Fast Expert (`gpt-4o-mini`)** - Quick response generation for efficiency  
3. **Verification Expert (`gpt-4o`)** - Cross-validation and accuracy checking

### Operator Patterns

- **@op Decorators**: Transform simple functions into full Ember operators
- **Built-in Ensemble**: Uses Ember's Ensemble operator for clean aggregation  
- **ModelCall Integration**: Access to full Response objects with metadata
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, add complexity only when needed

### Performance Optimizations

- **JIT Compilation**: `@jit` decorator automatically optimizes the compound system
- **Parallel Processing**: `vmap()` processes multiple questions simultaneously
- **Operator Composition**: Clean chaining and composition of operations
- **Automatic Caching**: JAX-based caching of compiled functions for repeated calls

## Code Structure

```python
# Simple operators using @op decorator
@op
def format_gpqa_question(item: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    # Format question with choices

@op  
def extract_answer(response) -> str:
    # Extract letter answer from Response.text

# Expert operators using ModelCall
reasoning_expert = ModelCall("o1-mini", temperature=0.1)
fast_expert = ModelCall("gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.3)
verification_expert = ModelCall("gpt-4o", temperature=0.2)

# JIT-optimized compound system
@jit
def compound_system(question_item: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Format question
    formatted_question = format_gpqa_question(question_item)
    
    # Create ensemble of experts
    expert_ensemble = Ensemble([reasoning_expert, fast_expert, verification_expert])
    
    # Get responses and extract answers
    responses = expert_ensemble(formatted_question)
    answers = [extract_answer(response) for response in responses]
    
    # Simple majority voting
    ensemble_answer = Counter(answers).most_common(1)[0][0]
    
    return {"ensemble_answer": ensemble_answer, ...}

# Parallel batch processing  
batch_compound_system = vmap(compound_system)
results = batch_compound_system(questions)
```

## Key Benefits

### From Compound Optimization Research
- **Multi-expert Architecture** - Leverages specialized models for different reasoning tasks
- **Ensemble Voting** - Simple majority voting with built-in Ensemble operator
- **Verification Loops** - Cross-validation between different expert approaches

### From Ember-v2 Framework
- **Operator Patterns** - @op decorators and built-in operators for clean code
- **Zero-config Optimization** - JIT compilation with no manual tuning required
- **Rich Metadata** - ModelCall provides full Response objects with tokens/costs
- **Progressive Disclosure** - Simple operators compose into complex systems
- **Automatic Parallelization** - vmap handles concurrency transparently

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.11+
- **API Keys**: OpenAI and/or Anthropic (configured via `ember setup`)
- **Internet**: For GPQA dataset loading (falls back to mock data if unavailable)

## Extending the Example

### Adding New Experts

```python
def create_domain_expert(domain: str) -> callable:
    """Create expert specialized for specific domain."""
    def domain_expert(question: str) -> ExpertResponse:
        specialized_prompt = f"As a {domain} expert: {question}"
        response = models("gpt-4o", specialized_prompt)
        # ... implementation
    return domain_expert
```

### Custom Ensemble Strategies

```python
def consensus_voting(expert_responses: List[ExpertResponse]) -> str:
    """Require majority consensus for high-confidence answers."""
    answer_counts = {}
    for response in expert_responses:
        answer_counts[response.answer] = answer_counts.get(response.answer, 0) + 1
    
    # Return answer with majority vote
    return max(answer_counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
```

### Different Datasets

```python
# Easy substitution for other datasets
questions = list(stream("mmlu", subset="physics", max_items=50))
questions = list(stream("arc", split="challenge", max_items=25))
```

## Performance Notes

- **First Run**: JIT compilation adds ~2-3s overhead for optimization
- **Subsequent Runs**: Near-optimal performance with compiled functions  
- **Parallel Scaling**: Linear speedup up to API rate limits
- **Memory Usage**: Constant memory footprint regardless of dataset size

## Integration with Research

This example demonstrates key patterns from compound optimization research:

- **Expert Specialization**: Different models for different reasoning types
- **Confidence Calibration**: Using model confidence for ensemble weighting
- **Verification Strategies**: Cross-validation between expert approaches  
- **Performance Optimization**: JIT compilation and parallel processing
- **Evaluation Frameworks**: Systematic accuracy and confidence tracking

Perfect for researchers exploring compound AI systems, ensemble methods, and optimization techniques in practical settings.
