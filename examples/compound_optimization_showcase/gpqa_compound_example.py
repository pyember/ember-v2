"""GPQA Compound System Example - Ember-v2 Showcase

This example demonstrates ember-v2's compound AI capabilities using proper
operator patterns. It features:

- JIT-optimized compound system with multiple expert models
- Built-in Ensemble operator for clean aggregation
- @op decorators for simple transformations
- ModelCall operators with full Response metadata
- Parallel processing with vmap
- Minimal, clean code showcasing Ember-v2 patterns

Usage:
    python gpqa_compound_example.py

Requirements:
    - API keys configured via `ember setup` or environment variables
    - Internet connection for GPQA dataset loading
