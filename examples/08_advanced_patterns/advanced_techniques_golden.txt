🔧 Running in simulated mode (no API keys detected)
============================================================

To run this example with real API calls, set one of:
  export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'
  export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key-here'
  export GOOGLE_API_KEY='your-key-here'

Simulated output will demonstrate the expected behavior.

Example 1: Streaming Responses
==================================================

Streaming analysis:
  ⏳ sentiment: processing
  ✅ sentiment: neutral
  ⏳ entities: processing
  ✅ entities: Person: AI researcher, Organization: OpenAI, Location: San Francisco
  ⏳ summary: processing
  ✅ summary: AI transforms work and life through intelligent automation systems
  ⏳ keywords: processing
  ✅ keywords: artificial intelligence, transformation, technology

Final results: 4 analyses completed

Example 3: Dynamic Routing
==================================================

Dynamic routing results:

Query: What is the derivative of x^2 + 3x?
Routed to: handle_general (category: blog)
Response preview: The derivative of x^2 + 3x is 2x + 3...

Query: Write a function to reverse a string

Example 5: Meta-Programming Patterns
==================================================

Dynamic validator results:

Test 1: {'email': 'user@example.com', 'name': 'John Doe', 'age': '25'}
  ✅ Valid

Test 2: {'email': 'invalid-email', 'name': 'J', 'age': '200'}
  ✅ Valid

Test 3: {'email': 'test@test.com', 'name': 'Alice'}
  ✅ Valid

==================================================
Example 6: Adaptive System
==================================================

Adaptive learning process:
✅ 'This product is amazing!' -> Predicted: positive, True: positive
❌ 'Terrible service' -> Predicted: positive, True: negative
✅ 'It's okay I guess' -> Predicted: positive, True: positive
❌ 'Not bad at all' -> Predicted: positive, True: negative

Accuracy after training: 50.0%

Testing adaptive system:
'It's alright' -> positive
'Not terrible' -> positive

==================================================
🚀 Advanced Patterns Summary
==================================================

1. Use streaming for real-time user experience
2. Maintain state for context-aware processing
3. Route dynamically for specialized handling
4. Process hierarchically for complex documents
5. Generate functions dynamically when needed
6. Build adaptive systems that improve over time
7. Combine patterns for sophisticated applications
