# Compound AI Systems

Learn to build sophisticated AI systems by composing multiple models, operators, and processing stages. These examples demonstrate ensemble patterns, judges, synthesis, and progressive complexity using Ember's new model primitives.

## Examples

### [simple_ensemble.py](./simple_ensemble.py) | ~5 min
Build ensemble systems using ModelText operators, custom voting strategies, and batch processing with `@jit` optimization.

### [operators_progressive_disclosure.py](./operators_progressive_disclosure.py) | ~15 min  
Explore Ember's 5-level operator complexity: from simple `@op` functions to JAX-integrated learnable systems.

### [judge_synthesis.py](./judge_synthesis.py) | ~12 min
Implement judge systems for response evaluation and synthesis patterns for combining multiple AI perspectives.

### [specifications_progressive.py](./specifications_progressive.py) | ~10 min
Master progressive specification complexity: from no validation to rich EmberModel validation with prompt templates.

## Learning Workflows

**Quick Start (15 min):** `simple_ensemble.py` → `judge_synthesis.py`

**Model Primitives (25 min):** All examples focusing on ModelCall/ModelText usage

**Advanced Patterns (40 min):** All examples in order for complete system patterns

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:** Complete `02_core_concepts`, understand operators

```bash
# Optional: Set API keys for real model usage  
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Run examples (work without API keys in demo mode)
cd examples/04_compound_ai
uv run python simple_ensemble.py
```

## Key Concepts

- **ModelCall/ModelText**: New model primitives for response handling
- **Ensemble/Chain**: Operator composition patterns  
- **Progressive disclosure**: Scale complexity only when needed
- **Judge systems**: Automated response evaluation and selection
- **Synthesis**: Combining multiple perspectives coherently
