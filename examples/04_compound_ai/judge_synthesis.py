"""Judge Synthesis - Building AI systems with judging and synthesis.

Learn how to build compound AI systems that use judges to evaluate
outputs and synthesis to combine multiple perspectives.

Example:
    >>> from ember.api import models
    >>> responses = [model(prompt) for model in ["gpt-3.5", "gpt-4"]]
    >>> judge_response = judge_model("Which response is better?")
