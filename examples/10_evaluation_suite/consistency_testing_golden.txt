  Consistency Testing
==================================================

🎯 Why Consistency Testing Matters:

• Builds user trust
• Ensures reliability
• Identifies model issues
• Validates deployments
• Maintains quality standards

=== Basic Consistency Testing ===

Testing model consistency:
  • Same input → Same output?
  • Similar inputs → Similar outputs?
  • Deterministic behavior?
  • Stable across time?

Test: Run same prompt 5 times
Prompt: "What is the capital of France?"

Results:
  Run 1: Paris
  Run 2: Paris
  Run 3: Paris
  Run 4: The capital of France is Paris
  Run 5: Paris

Consistency score: 4/5 (80%)
Issue: Response format varies


=== Semantic Consistency ===

Testing semantic equivalence:

Question: "What is 2+2?"
Responses:
  • 4
  • Four
  • The answer is 4
  • 2+2 equals 4
Semantic consistency: ✓ (All convey same meaning)

Question: "Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?"
Responses:
  • Shakespeare
  • William Shakespeare
  • It was written by Shakespeare
Semantic consistency: ✓ (All convey same meaning)

Question: "Is water wet?"
Responses:
  • Yes
  • Yes, water is wet
  • Water is indeed wet
Semantic consistency: ✓ (All convey same meaning)



=== Input Perturbation Testing ===

Testing robustness to input variations:

Base prompt and variations:
  1. 'Explain photosynthesis'
  2. 'explain photosynthesis'
  3. 'Explain photosynthesis.'
  4. 'Explain  photosynthesis'
  5. 'Explain photosynthesis
'
  6. 'Can you explain photosynthesis?'

Expected: Similar responses for all variations
Testing for:
  • Case sensitivity
  • Whitespace handling
  • Punctuation robustness
  • Format flexibility


=== Temporal Consistency ===

Testing consistency over time:

Test scenario: Ask same question daily for a week
Question: "What are the main programming paradigms?"

Daily responses:
  Monday: Object-oriented, functional, procedural
  Tuesday: OOP, functional, procedural programming
  Wednesday: Object-oriented, functional, procedural
  Thursday: Object-oriented, functional, and procedural
  Friday: OOP, FP, and procedural paradigms
  Saturday: Object-oriented, functional, procedural
  Sunday: The main paradigms are OOP, functional, procedural

Analysis:
  • Content: Consistent ✓
  • Format: Variable ⚠
  • Terminology: Mixed (OOP vs Object-oriented)


=== Cross-Model Consistency ===

Comparing consistency across models:

Question: "What is machine learning?"

Model responses:
  GPT-3.5: Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data
  GPT-4: Machine learning is a field of AI where computers learn patterns from data without explicit programming
  Claude: Machine learning is an AI approach where algorithms improve through experience with data

Consistency analysis:
  • Core concept: Consistent ✓
  • Key terms: AI, data, learn ✓
  • Detail level: Varies
  • Technical accuracy: Consistent ✓


=== Consistency Metrics ===

Measuring consistency:

1. Exact Match Rate:
   Identical responses / Total runs
   Example: 8/10 = 80%

2. Semantic Similarity:
   Average cosine similarity of embeddings
   Example: 0.95 (very similar)

3. Key Information Retention:
   Critical facts preserved / Total facts
   Example: 15/15 = 100%

4. Format Consistency:
   Responses with same structure / Total
   Example: 6/10 = 60%

5. Confidence Variance:
   Standard deviation of confidence scores
   Example: σ = 0.05 (low variance)


=== Edge Case Consistency ===

Testing consistency on edge cases:

Edge case tests:
  Empty input:
    Input: ''
    Expected: Should handle gracefully
  Very long input:
    Input: [10,000 chars]
    Expected: Should truncate/summarize
  Special characters:
    Input: 🎉 ñ © π
    Expected: Should process correctly
  Mixed languages:
    Input: Hello 你好 Bonjour
    Expected: Should handle appropriately
  Contradictory request:
    Input: Be brief but explain in detail
    Expected: Should clarify or choose
  Nonsense input:
    Input: Colorless green ideas sleep
    Expected: Should indicate confusion

Consistency requirements:
  • Never crash or error out
  • Provide meaningful response
  • Maintain safety guidelines
  • Be predictable in handling


=== Consistency Test Suite ===

Comprehensive testing framework:

1. Setup Phase:
   • Define test prompts
   • Set consistency thresholds
   • Configure test parameters

2. Execution Phase:
   For each test case:
     • Run N times with same parameters
     • Run with parameter variations
     • Run at different times
     • Run on different models

3. Analysis Phase:
   • Calculate consistency scores
   • Identify outliers
   • Group similar responses
   • Generate report

4. Sample Report:
   ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Consistency Test Results        │
   ├─────────────────────────────────┤
   │ Total test cases: 50            │
   │ Exact match rate: 76%           │
   │ Semantic similarity: 0.92       │
   │ Format consistency: 84%         │
   │ Edge case handling: PASS        │
   │ Temporal stability: 91%         │
   └─────────────────────────────────┘


=== Automated Consistency Monitoring ===

Continuous consistency monitoring:

1. Real-time tracking:
   • Log all model inputs/outputs
   • Calculate rolling consistency metrics
   • Alert on anomalies

2. A/B testing:
   • Compare model versions
   • Track consistency changes
   • Measure drift over time

3. Dashboard example:
   Consistency Metrics (Last 24h)
   ├─ Response similarity: 94.2% ↑
   ├─ Format consistency: 87.5% →
   ├─ Semantic drift: 0.03 ↓
   └─ Error rate: 0.1% →

==================================================
✅ Consistency Testing Best Practices
==================================================

1. Define clear consistency criteria
2. Test multiple dimensions (semantic, format, etc.)
3. Include edge cases and adversarial inputs
4. Monitor consistency over time
5. Set appropriate thresholds for your use case
6. Automate testing in CI/CD pipeline
7. Document expected variations

🔧 Testing Strategies:
• Use fixed random seeds when possible
• Test with temperature=0 for determinism
• Create comprehensive test suites
• Version your test cases
• Track metrics over time
