"""Chain of Thought - Step-by-step reasoning for complex problems.

Learn how to implement chain-of-thought prompting to improve reasoning
capabilities and solve complex problems systematically.

Example:
    >>> from ember.api import models
    >>> prompt = "Let's solve this step by step:\\n" + problem
    >>> response = models("gpt-4", prompt)
