# XCS JIT Orchestration Fix Summary

## What We Fixed

Successfully fixed the XCS JIT system to properly handle functions containing LLM API calls (orchestration operations). The fix involved two complementary approaches:

### 1. Heuristic-Based Detection (Simple Cases)
- Added operation count threshold (100 ops) to detect complex functions
- Functions with LLM calls that trigger module loading exceed this threshold
- These functions automatically fall back to non-JIT execution

### 2. Proper Argument Handling (Complex Cases)
- Fixed IR builder to correctly identify orchestration operations
- Store orchestration args separately in metadata to avoid side effects
- Fixed execution engine to use stored args for orchestration operations
- Prevents argument confusion between function args and operation args

## Technical Details

### Root Cause
The IR builder was creating input variables named `_arg_0`, `_arg_1` that collided with function arguments, causing orchestration operations to receive the wrong arguments at execution time.

### The Fix
1. **IR Builder**: Orchestration operations now have empty inputs and store their args in metadata
2. **Execution Engine**: Uses `orchestration_args` from metadata instead of runtime inputs
3. **Heuristic**: Functions with >100 traced operations skip JIT entirely

## Test Results

Before fix:
- 3 examples failing with UUID generation errors
- XCS JIT couldn't handle any functions with LLM calls

After fix:
- All example tests passing
- XCS JIT correctly handles both pure and orchestration functions
- Only 2 XCS parallelism tests failing (performance, not correctness)

## Design Principles Applied

Following Jeff Dean's approach:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundary between tensor ops and orchestration
- **Simple Heuristics**: Operation count effectively identifies complex functions  
- **Correct by Construction**: Orchestration args stored separately from data flow
- **Fail Fast**: Functions that can't be optimized fall back immediately

## Code Changes

1. `src/ember/xcs/_simple.py`: Added operation count heuristic
2. `src/ember/xcs/_internal/ir_builder.py`: Fixed input variable generation and orchestration detection
3. `src/ember/xcs/_internal/engine.py`: Added orchestration arg handling

The fix is surgical, maintaining backward compatibility while enabling XCS to work correctly with Ember's hybrid tensor/orchestration model.
