# Vmap Orchestration Test Fix

## Problem
The `test_vmap_orchestration_operations` test was failing because it expected a >2x speedup but was getting 0.92x. The test was measuring:
- Sequential execution: 4 operations @ 0.05s each = ~0.2s expected
- Vmap execution: Should be parallel, so ~0.05s expected
- Expected speedup: 4x theoretical, >2x required

## Root Cause
The test was including compilation/tracing overhead in the timing measurements. For vmap operations, the first call includes:
1. JAX tracing the function
2. Building the computation graph
3. Compiling the vectorized version
4. Setting up batch execution infrastructure

This overhead can be significant, especially for simple operations where the compilation time exceeds the actual execution time.

## Solution
Added warm-up calls before timing:
```python
# Warm up both functions to exclude compilation overhead
_ = orchestration_function(batch[0])  # Warm up sequential
vmapped_fn = vmap(orchestration_function)
_ = vmapped_fn(batch[:1])  # Warm up vmap with single item
```

This ensures we're measuring actual execution performance, not compilation time.

## Result
- Test now passes consistently
- Measures true parallelization speedup
- Follows JAX best practices for benchmarking

## Lesson
When benchmarking JAX transformations (jit, vmap, pmap), always:
1. Warm up with a representative call first
2. Time subsequent calls for actual performance
3. Consider compilation as a one-time cost
4. Document when timing includes/excludes compilation

This aligns with how JAX is used in production - compilation happens once, execution happens many times.
