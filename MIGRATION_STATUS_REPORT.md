## Key Issues to Address

1. **Import Errors**: Several examples have outdated imports (e.g., vmap location)
2. **API Changes**: Some examples use old Ember APIs that need updating
3. **Test Configuration**: Some tests expect sections that don't exist
4. **Conditional Pattern**: Many examples still need @conditional_llm decorator

## Next Steps

1. Fix failing tests in 02_core_concepts by updating test configurations
2. Investigate and fix import errors across examples
3. Continue migrating examples that make actual API calls
4. Update golden outputs for examples that have been fixed
5. Enable CI pipeline once more tests are passing

## Success Metrics

- Infrastructure: ✅ Complete and working
- Testing Framework: ✅ Robust and operational
- Migration Pattern: ✅ Proven successful
- Documentation: ✅ Clear and helpful
- CI/CD: ⏸️  Ready but not enabled

The golden testing framework is working excellently, and the conditional execution pattern has been proven successful across multiple examples. The main work remaining is completing the migration of examples and fixing test configurations.
