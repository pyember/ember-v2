## Risk Areas

1. **Provider API Stability**: External services may change
2. **Concurrency Bugs**: Hard to reproduce consistently  
3. **Memory Profiling**: Python makes this tricky
4. **Performance Variance**: CI machines vary
5. **Golden File Maintenance**: Can become brittle

## Notes

- Start with most critical user paths
- Use real services sparingly (cost)
- Keep tests fast for rapid iteration
- Document surprising behaviors
- Track flaky tests aggressively
