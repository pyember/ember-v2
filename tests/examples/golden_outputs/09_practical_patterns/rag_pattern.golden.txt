‚úÖ Key Takeaways
==================================================

1. RAG separates retrieval from generation
2. Operators handle each stage independently
3. Clean composition creates powerful systems
4. Each component is testable and reusable
5. Real implementations would use:
   - Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.)
   - Real embeddings (OpenAI, Sentence Transformers)
   - LLMs for generation
