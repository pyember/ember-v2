"""Unit tests for advanced tracing, parallel execution, and error handling.

This module defines dummy operator implementations to simulate wide ensembles,
nested operator structures, parallel execution, and failure scenarios. It verifies
that the new tracer and JIT systems record operator invocations correctly, that a
JIT-decorated operator can be "converted" into an XCS graph, and that running that graph
with the XCS engine in parallel is significantly faster than sequential execution.
