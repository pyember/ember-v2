Test XCS Implementation

This example demonstrates the use of the XCS (Accelerated Compound Systems)  API
directly. It shows how to use JIT compilation, vectorization, and automatic
graph building for high-performance operator execution.

To run:
    uv run python src/ember/examples/test_xcs_implementation.py
