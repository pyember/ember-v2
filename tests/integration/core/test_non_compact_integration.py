"""
Integration tests for Compact Network of Networks (NON) Graph Notation.

This module tests the integration of the compact notation system with real
operators and execution flows. It verifies that graphs built with the compact
notation produce the expected computational behavior, not just structure.

Following Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat's design principles, these tests focus on:
1. Validating expected operational behavior (not just object structure)
2. Testing the full composition of components as they would be used in practice
3. Ensuring reliable performance across complex configurations
