"""
Comprehensive performance tests for nested JIT operators.

This test suite measures the performance characteristics of different JIT implementations
on realistic nested operator structures that mimic production use cases, particularly:

1. Ensemble + Judge pattern (10 unit ensemble with judge at depth 2)
2. Different parallelization and JIT strategies for this pattern
3. Comparative benchmarks between different JIT implementations

The tests use proper operators structured according to Ember conventions.
