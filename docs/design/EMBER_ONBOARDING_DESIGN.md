# Ember Interactive Onboarding Experience

## Vision

Create an onboarding experience so delightful that users can't help but share it. Think of it as a conversation with a knowledgeable friend who's excited to help you succeed.

## Core Principles

1. **Zero to Magic in 60 Seconds** - Users should see something amazing happen quickly
2. **Progressive Disclosure** - Start simple, reveal complexity only when needed
3. **Failure-Proof** - Anticipate and gracefully handle every possible error
4. **Delightful Details** - Small touches that make users smile
5. **Community Building** - Natural opportunities to connect with others

## The Experience Flow

### 1. First Touch (0-10 seconds)
```python
$ ember

🎭 Welcome to Ember AI!

I'll help you get started in just a few steps.
First, let me check your environment...

✓ Python 3.10+ detected
✓ Required packages installed
✗ No API keys found

Let's fix that! Which AI provider would you like to start with?

1. OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5)      - Most popular
2. Anthropic (Claude 3)         - Best for complex reasoning
3. Google (Gemini)              - Great free tier
4. Local Models                 - No API key needed

→ Choose [1-4]: _
```

### 2. API Key Setup (10-30 seconds)
```python
Great choice! Let's set up OpenAI.

📎 Need an API key? Here's how:
   1. Visit: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   2. Click "Create new secret key"
   3. Copy the key (starts with sk-...)

Paste your API key (hidden): ****
✓ Valid API key detected!

Would you like me to:
1. Save to .env file (recommended)
2. Set environment variable
3. Use for this session only

→ Choose [1-3]: 1

✓ Saved to .env file
💡 Tip: Ember will automatically load this file
```

### 3. First Magic Moment (30-60 seconds)
```python
Awesome! Let's try something fun:

🎭 Running your first Ember command...

>>> ember.models("gpt-3.5-turbo", "Write a haiku about AI")

Silent circuits think,
Digital dreams take new form—
Future blooms in code.

✨ Nice! You just made your first AI call with Ember.

### 4. Interactive Examples
```python
Let's build a simple chatbot!

📝 Creating chatbot.py...

from ember import models

def chat():
    print("🤖 Chatbot ready! Type 'quit' to exit.\n")
    
    history = []
    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() == 'quit':
            break
            
        # Add context from history
        prompt = f"Previous: {history[-2:]}\nUser: {user_input}\nAssistant:"
        
        response = models("gpt-3.5-turbo", prompt)
        print(f"Bot: {response}\n")
        
        history.append(f"User: {user_input}")
        history.append(f"Bot: {response}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    chat()

✓ Created chatbot.py

Run it with: python chatbot.py

Want me to:
1. Run it now
2. Show more examples
3. Explain the code
4. Create something else

→ Choose [1-4]: _
```

## Advanced Features

### Environment Detection
```python
# Automatically detect and suggest fixes
✗ CUDA not available - Using CPU
  → Install CUDA 12.1: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

✗ Low memory detected (4GB)
  → Consider using smaller models or cloud options
```

### Smart Suggestions
```python
# Based on user's choices, suggest next steps
Since you're using GPT-4, you might like:
- Advanced reasoning with Chain-of-Thought
- Multi-step pipelines with operators
- Cost optimization techniques
```

### Error Recovery
```python
# Graceful handling of common issues
Oops! API rate limit hit. 

Here's what you can do:
1. Wait 60 seconds (I'll count down)
2. Switch to a different model
3. Use a cached response
4. Learn about rate limit strategies

→ Choose [1-4]: _
```

        self.state = self.load_state()
        self.theme = Theme()  # Colors, emojis, formatting
        
    def start(self):
        if self.state.completed:
