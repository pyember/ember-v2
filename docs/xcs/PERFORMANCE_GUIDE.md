# XCS Performance Optimization Guide

This guide provides recommendations for optimizing the performance of code using the XCS framework.

## Performance Principles

When optimizing code with XCS, follow these general principles:

1. **Identify Hot Spots**: Focus on optimizing the portions of your code that consume the most time
2. **Minimize Data Movement**: Reduce copying of large data structures between operations
3. **Increase Parallelism**: Make use of parallelization transforms where appropriate
4. **Batch Processing**: Process items in batches rather than individually
5. **Precompile Operations**: Use precompilation for frequently executed operations

## JIT Optimization

The `jit` decorator is a powerful tool for optimizing operator execution:

```python
from ember.api.xcs import jit, JITOptions

@jit(options=JITOptions(
    sample_input={"query": "example"},  # Precompile with sample input
    cache_size=100                      # Increase cache size for varied inputs
))
class MyOperator(Operator):
    def forward(self, *, inputs):
        # Complex computation
        return processed_result
```

### JIT Best Practices

1. **Precompile with Sample Inputs**: Provide sample inputs to precompile operations
2. **Set Appropriate Cache Size**: Increase cache size for operators with varied input patterns
3. **Minimize Side Effects**: Avoid operations with side effects in JIT-compiled code
4. **Move Invariant Computations**: Place invariant computations in `__init__` instead of `forward`
5. **Use Pure Functions**: Favor pure functions that depend only on their inputs

## Structural Analysis

For complex operators that compose multiple sub-operators, use `structural_jit`:

```python
from ember.api.xcs import structural_jit

@structural_jit(execution_strategy="parallel")
class CompositeOperator(Operator):
    def __init__(self):
        self.op1 = SubOperator1()
        self.op2 = SubOperator2()
        self.op3 = SubOperator3()
        
    def forward(self, *, inputs):
        # Operations automatically parallelized based on dependencies
        result1 = self.op1(inputs=inputs)
        result2 = self.op2(inputs=inputs)
        result3 = self.op3(inputs=result1, auxiliary=result2)
        return result3
```

### Structural JIT Best Practices

1. **Expose Parallelism**: Structure code to expose potential parallelism
2. **Keep Operators Small**: Use many small operators rather than few large ones
3. **Clear Dependencies**: Make data dependencies explicit in operator interfaces
4. **Avoid Circular Dependencies**: Structure operators to avoid circular dependencies
5. **Consider Granularity**: Balance parallelism with overhead (too fine-grained can be slower)

## Parallelization Transforms

Use transforms to enable parallel processing:

```python
from ember.api.xcs import vmap, pmap

# Vectorize for batch processing
batch_fn = vmap(single_item_function)
batch_results = batch_fn([item1, item2, item3])

# Parallelize across devices/cores
parallel_fn = pmap(heavy_computation, num_workers=8)
parallel_results = parallel_fn(large_dataset)
```

### Transforms Best Practices

1. **Right-Size Batches**: Choose batch sizes that balance parallelism with memory usage
2. **Tune Worker Count**: Adjust `num_workers` based on your workload and available cores
3. **Separate Constants**: Use `in_axes` to mark constant arguments in `vmap`
4. **Consider Work Size**: Use `pmap` only when work units are substantial enough
5. **Combine Transforms**: Compose transforms when appropriate (e.g., `pmap(vmap(f))`)

## Distributed Execution

For very large workloads, use mesh-based distribution:

```python
from ember.api.xcs import mesh_sharded, DeviceMesh, PartitionSpec

# Create a device mesh
mesh = DeviceMesh(shape=(2, 2))

# Define partitioning strategy
pspec = PartitionSpec(0, 1)

# Create a sharded function
sharded_fn = mesh_sharded(function, mesh=mesh, partition_spec=pspec)
results = sharded_fn(large_dataset)
```

### Distributed Execution Best Practices

1. **Choose Mesh Topology**: Select a mesh shape that matches your computation pattern
2. **Select Partition Strategy**: Choose partitioning that minimizes communication
3. **Data Preparation**: Organize data to align with your partitioning strategy
4. **Load Balancing**: Ensure work is distributed evenly across devices
5. **Minimize Communication**: Structure algorithms to reduce cross-device communication

## Execution Configuration

Fine-tune execution behavior with execution options:

```python
from ember.api.xcs import execution_options

with execution_options(
    use_parallel=True,      # Control parallel execution
    max_workers=8,          # Set concurrency level
    timeout_seconds=30.0    # Set execution timeout
):
    results = complex_operation(data)
```

### Execution Configuration Best Practices

1. **Match Execution Mode to Workload**: Use `use_parallel=True` for parallelizable work, `use_parallel=False` for linear work
2. **Control Concurrency**: Set `max_workers` based on your system's capabilities
3. **Set Timeouts**: Use `timeout_seconds` to prevent runaway computations
4. **Local Configuration**: Apply configuration at the smallest scope needed
5. **Monitoring**: Use `trace_execution=True` to identify performance bottlenecks

## Memory Optimization

Optimize memory usage for better performance:

1. **Avoid Redundant Copies**: Reuse data structures when possible
2. **Use Views/References**: Prefer views over copies for large data
3. **Clean Up Resources**: Release resources when no longer needed
4. **Preallocate**: Preallocate buffers for known-size operations
5. **Incremental Processing**: Process large datasets in chunks

## Common Bottlenecks

Watch for these common performance bottlenecks:

1. **Excessive Tracing**: Repeated tracing of the same operation patterns
2. **Serialization Overhead**: Converting between formats unnecessarily
3. **Unbalanced Work Distribution**: Some workers idle while others overloaded
4. **Memory Contention**: Multiple operations competing for memory bandwidth
5. **Dependency Chains**: Long chains of dependent operations that can't parallelize

## Performance Analysis

To identify performance issues:

1. **Use XCS Tracing**: Enable execution tracing to see operation timing
2. **Profile Time Distribution**: Identify which operations take the most time
3. **Analyze Parallelism**: Check if operations are executing in parallel
4. **Check Cache Hit Rates**: Monitor JIT compilation cache hit rates
5. **Examine Memory Usage**: Watch for excessive memory allocations
