# XCS: What We're Actually Building

## One Sentence

**Make parallel code run in parallel with zero configuration.**

## The Problem

Right now in Ember:
```python
# This runs sequentially even though it could be parallel
results = [model(x) for x in data]  # Each model call waits for the previous one
```

## The Solution

```python
from ember.xcs import jit

@jit
def process(data):
    return [model(x) for x in data]  # Now runs in parallel automatically
```

## How It Works

1. **First call**: Traces execution to understand what can be parallel
2. **Analysis**: Identifies independent operations
3. **Subsequent calls**: Executes independent operations in parallel
4. **Fallback**: If anything fails, uses original function

## What It Does

✅ Makes independent operations run in parallel
✅ Preserves exact function behavior  
✅ Falls back gracefully on any error
✅ Provides simple performance stats

## What It Doesn't Do

❌ No configuration options
❌ No global learning
❌ No distributed execution  
❌ No behavior changes
❌ No magic

## Implementation

1. **Trace** function execution to build operation graph
2. **Analyze** graph to find independent operations
3. **Execute** independent operations in parallel
4. **Cache** optimization for repeated patterns

## Code Example

```python
# User writes this
@jit
def analyze_documents(docs):
    results = []
    for doc in docs:
        # These are independent - will run in parallel
        sentiment = sentiment_model(doc)
        summary = summary_model(doc)
        entities = entity_model(doc)
        
        results.append({
            'sentiment': sentiment,
            'summary': summary,
            'entities': entities
        })
    return results

# That's it. No configuration. It just runs faster.
```

## Technical Details

- Uses Python's ThreadPoolExecutor for parallelism
- Traces execution with proxy objects
- Caches optimization per function/argument pattern
- Falls back to original on any error
- No external dependencies

## Success Metrics

1. **It works**: Parallel code runs in parallel
2. **It's simple**: One decorator, no config
3. **It's safe**: Never changes behavior
4. **It's fast**: 2-4x speedup on parallel workloads

## Not Goals

- Beat hand-optimized code
- Handle distributed computing
- Optimize sequential code
- Learn from usage patterns
- Provide configuration options

## FAQ

**Q: What if my code can't be parallelized?**
A: It runs normally. No slower than before.

**Q: What if optimization fails?**
A: It runs the original function. Always safe.

**Q: Can I configure it?**
A: No. It just works or it doesn't.

**Q: How do I know if it's working?**
A: `my_function.stats()` shows basic metrics.

**Q: Does it work with async?**
A: Not in v1. Sync functions only.

## The Promise

**If your code has parallel opportunities, @jit will find and use them. If not, it does nothing. Either way, your code works exactly the same, just potentially faster.**

That's the entire product.
