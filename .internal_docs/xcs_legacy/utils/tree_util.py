XCS Tree Utilities

This module provides registration and transformation utilities for immutable
EmberModules and other tree-like objects within the Ember system. It implements
functions analogous to JAX's pytrees for structural decomposition and reconstruction
of arbitrarily nested data structures:

  • register_tree: Registers a type with its custom flatten and unflatten functions.
  • tree_flatten: Recursively flattens an object into its constituent leaves and
                  auxiliary metadata.
  • tree_unflatten: Reconstructs an object from its auxiliary metadata and flattened leaves.

All functions enforce strong type annotations and require named parameter invocation.

This module enables critical XCS system capabilities:
1. Transforms like vmap and pmap operate on nested structures without manual handling
2. JIT compilation analyzes and optimizes operators by decomposing their structure
3. Execution engines efficiently traverse complex object graphs

Examples:
    # Registering a custom type
    class MyType:
        def __init__(self, value):
            self.value = value

    def flatten_my_type(obj):
        return [obj.value], (type(obj), None)

    def unflatten_my_type(aux_data, children):
        cls, _ = aux_data
        return cls(children[0])

    register_tree(
        cls=MyType,
        flatten_func=flatten_my_type,
        unflatten_func=unflatten_my_type
    )

    # Using tree operations
    obj = {"a": MyType(1), "b": [MyType(2), MyType(3)]}
    leaves, aux_data = tree_flatten(tree=obj)  # leaves = [1, 2, 3]
    reconstructed = tree_unflatten(aux=aux_data, children=leaves)  # Same structure as obj
