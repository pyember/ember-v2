"""Execution engine for XCS computation graphs.

Provides the core execution engine for running computational graphs with
different scheduling strategies and optimizations. This module forms the
foundation for the XCS system's execution capabilities.

The engine follows a unified architecture with clean separation of concerns
between graph construction, scheduling, and execution.
