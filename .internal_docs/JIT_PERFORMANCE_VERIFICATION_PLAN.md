# JIT Performance Verification Plan

## Objective
Verify that JIT compilation provides measurable performance benefits across different operator types and workloads, following Jeff Dean's principle: "Measure everything that matters."

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Does JIT actually make code faster?**
   - Compare JIT vs non-JIT execution times
   - Measure compilation overhead vs execution speedup
   - Identify break-even points (when compilation cost is amortized)

2. **Which strategy performs best for which patterns?**
   - structural analysis provides performance improvements for I/O-bound operations: Y% (pattern: ...)
- Worst case degradation: Z% (pattern: ...)

## Strategy Performance
| Pattern | Trace | Structural | Enhanced | AUTO Choice |
|---------|-------|------------|----------|-------------|
| Simple  | 1.0x  | 0.95x      | 0.9x     | Trace ✓     |
| Ensemble| 0.8x  | 1.2x       | 1.5x     | Enhanced ✓  |

2. Avoid JIT for: ...
3. Force strategy when: ...
