# Documentation Excellence Tracker

## Objective
Transform all documentation to world-class standards - the kind of precise, elegant documentation that legendary engineers would write.

## Standards
- **Clarity**: Every word serves a purpose
- **Precision**: Technical accuracy without ambiguity  
- **Elegance**: Simple, but not simplistic
- **Practicality**: Real-world usage examples that teach
- **Consistency**: Uniform voice and style throughout

## Documentation Patterns

### Module Docstring Pattern
```python
"""Single-line summary that captures the essence.

Extended description only if it adds crucial context.

Example:
    >>> from ember.module import Component
    >>> component = Component()
    >>> component.execute()
"""
```

### Class Docstring Pattern
```python
class Component:
    """What this component does in one line.
    
    Only include extended description if behavior is non-obvious.
    
    Attributes:
        name: What it represents (not "The name attribute").
        
    Example:
        >>> component = Component(name="example")
        >>> component.process()
    """
```

### Function Docstring Pattern
```python
def process(data: str, *, validate: bool = True) -> Result:
    """Process data and return result.
    
    Args:
        data: Input to process.
        validate: Whether to validate input.
        
    Returns:
        Processed result.
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If data is invalid.
    """
```

## Quality Criteria
1. Would Jeff Dean find this clear and sufficient?
2. Would Sanjay Ghemawat appreciate the technical precision?
3. Would Robert Martin approve of the clean structure?
4. Would Steve Jobs find it elegantly simple?

## Notes
- Remove all fluff and corporate speak
- Every example should teach something
- Comments explain "why", not "what"
- Assume reader is intelligent but new to the codebase
