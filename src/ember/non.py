"""
Network of Operators (NON) Pattern
=================================

The NON module provides composable building blocks for LLM application patterns.
These high-level operators encapsulate common patterns for ensemble generation,
aggregation, verification, and sequential processing.

Core components:
- UniformEnsemble: Generates multiple model responses using identical LLM configurations
- MostCommon: Implements majority-vote aggregation
- JudgeSynthesis: Uses a judge model to synthesize multiple responses
- Verifier: Performs factual and logical verification of responses
- Sequential: Chains operators together in a pipeline

Basic usage:
```python
import ember
from ember.non import UniformEnsemble, JudgeSynthesis, Sequential

# Create an ensemble with 3 identical models
ensemble = UniformEnsemble(
    num_units=3,
    model_name="openai:gpt-4o",
    temperature=1.0
)

# Create a judge to synthesize the outputs
judge = JudgeSynthesis(model_name="anthropic:claude-3-opus")

# Combine them sequentially
pipeline = Sequential(operators=[ensemble, judge])

# Execute the pipeline
result = pipeline(inputs={"query": "What is the future of AI?"})
```

For more advanced usage, see the documentation.
