"""
Compact NON Graph Notation Example

This example demonstrates Ember's compact graph notation for creating
complex operator graphs with minimal syntax, following the same design
principles favored by Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat: clean, precise,
orthogonal abstractions with maximal composability.
