# Advanced Ember Examples

This directory contains advanced examples demonstrating complex Ember systems, sophisticated AI architectures, and performance optimization techniques.

## Examples

- `parallel_pipeline_example.py` - Building and optimizing parallel execution pipelines
- `clean_jit_example.py` - Advanced JIT patterns for complex systems
- `example_architectures.py` - Reference architectures for complex AI systems
- `diagnose_model_discovery.py` - Debugging model discovery issues
- `test_auto_discovery.py` - Testing automatic model discovery

## Running Examples

To run any example, use the following command format:

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv run python src/ember/examples/advanced/example_name.py

# Or if in an activated virtual environment
python src/ember/examples/advanced/example_name.py
```

Replace `example_name.py` with the desired example file.

## Advanced Concepts

These examples demonstrate advanced Ember capabilities such as:

- Complex nested operator architectures
- Performance optimization techniques
