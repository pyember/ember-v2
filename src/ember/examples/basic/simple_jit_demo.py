"""Just-In-Time optimization with parallel execution demonstration.

This module demonstrates JIT compilation and parallel execution capabilities
provided by the Ember XCS engine. It showcases how computation graphs
are automatically traced, compiled, and optimized for different execution
strategies, with a focus on concurrent execution benefits.

Key concepts demonstrated:
1. JIT tracing and compilation of operator execution graphs
2. Performance comparison between sequential and parallel execution
3. Practical patterns for building concurrent operator workflows
4. Latency improvements through execution strategy optimization

Example usage:
    uv run python -m ember.examples.basic.simple_jit_demo
