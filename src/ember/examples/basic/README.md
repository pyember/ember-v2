This directory contains basic examples demonstrating core Ember concepts with minimal complexity. These examples are ideal for beginners getting started with the framework.

## Examples

- `minimal_example.py` - The simplest possible Ember operator with proper typing and structure
- `check_env.py` - Verify your environment is set up correctly for Ember (checks API keys and imports)
- `minimal_operator_example.py` - Basic example of creating and using an operator
- `simple_jit_demo.py` - Introduction to using the JIT system with performance comparisons
- `compact_notation_example.py` - Demonstrates compact notation patterns for operators
- `context_example.py` - Shows how to use the Ember context system for configuration

## Running Examples

To run any example, use the following command format:

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv run python src/ember/examples/basic/example_name.py

# Or if in an activated virtual environment
python src/ember/examples/basic/example_name.py
```

Replace `example_name.py` with the desired example file.

## Next Steps
