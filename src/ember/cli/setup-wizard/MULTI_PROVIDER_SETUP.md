# Multi-Provider Setup Enhancement

## Implementation Summary

This enhancement adds multi-provider configuration capability to the Ember setup wizard following SOLID principles and maintaining backward compatibility.

### 1. Setup Mode Selection (New Step)
- Users now see "Configure one provider" vs "Configure all providers (Recommended)"
- Shows which providers are already configured with their icons
- Skips already configured providers when doing "all" setup

### 2. Progress Indicator
- Visual progress bar showing: ✓ OpenAI ● Anthropic ○ Google
- Green checkmark for completed, yellow dot for current, gray circle for pending
- Only shows during multi-provider setup

### 3. Smart State Management
- Extended SetupState with optional fields (backward compatible)
- Tracks configured providers and remaining providers
- Automatically flows through each provider in sequence

### 4. Configuration Detection
- Checks both credentials file and environment variables
- `getConfiguredProviders()` returns a Set of configured provider names
- Prevents re-configuring already setup providers

## Architecture Decisions

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
2. **Open/Closed**: Extended existing types without modifying core flow
3. **Interface Segregation**: Optional fields don't affect single-provider mode
4. **Dependency Inversion**: Config utilities abstract file system details

## User Flow

### Initial Setup
```
ember setup
> Configure all providers (Recommended)
> Configure OpenAI API key...
> Test connection... ✓
> Configure Anthropic API key...
> Test connection... ✓
> Configure Google API key...
> Test connection... ✓
✨ Setup complete! Configured 3 providers
```

### Incremental Setup
```
ember setup
> Configure all providers (Recommended)
Already configured: 🚀
> Configure Anthropic API key...
> Configure Google API key...
✨ Setup complete! Configured 2 providers
```

## Implementation Details

- Type-safe TypeScript implementation
- React hooks for state management
- Asynchronous operations with proper error handling
- Immutable state updates
- Clear separation of concerns following single responsibility principle
