"""
Core EmberModule abstraction for immutable tree-transformable modules.

This module establishes the foundation for Ember's immutable, tree-transformable
module system. The base classes enable creation of modules that:

  1. Are immutable (frozen) dataclasses with controlled initialization.
  2. Automatically register with the transformation tree system.
  3. Support static fields that are excluded from tree transformations.
  4. Support custom converters for field initialization.
  5. Include thread-safe flattening/unflattening for tree transformations.

The EmberModule system is optimized for JAX-like transformations such as just-in-time
(JIT) compilation, maps, and future gradient computation while preserving
compatibility with a native Pythonic, object-oriented programming model.

    """Thread-safe, memory-efficient LRU cache for EmberModule flattening.

    This class provides a thread-isolated caching system optimized for
    transformation operations on EmberModule instances. It uses thread-local
    storage with identity-based keys (object IDs) to eliminate dependencies on
    hash or equality methods, preventing recursion issues when flattening objects
    that might themselves use the cache.

    The implementation offers:
    1. Thread isolation: Each thread has its own independent cache
    2. Memory safety: Tracking object lifetimes without circular dependencies
    3. Bounded growth: LRU eviction prevents unbounded memory consumption
    4. High performance: O(1) lookups and updates for common operations

    Technical details:
    - Uses thread.local() for thread isolation without lock contention
    - Implements the LRU algorithm using OrderedDict for O(1) reordering
    - Uses object identity (id) as cache keys to avoid hash method dependencies
    - Handles lifetime management through explicit API rather than weak references

    Thread-safety guarantees:
    - Thread-safe for all operations without locks (thread isolation)
    - No race conditions for cache updates within a thread
    - No shared state between threads, eliminating concurrency issues

    This cache is specifically optimized for transformation systems that apply
    the same operations to the same modules without creating circular dependencies.

class EmberModule(metaclass=EmberModuleMeta):
    """Base class for Ember's immutable, transformable modules.

    EmberModule provides the foundation for building immutable, strongly-typed modules
    that can be transformed by tree-based operations like JIT compilation, gradients,
    and vectorization. It combines Python's dataclass system with custom initialization
    and tree traversal mechanisms to create a framework optimized for transformation-based
    computation.

    Architectural principles:

    1. Immutability: Instances are frozen after initialization to prevent unexpected
       state mutations, improving reasoning about code and enabling parallel execution.

    2. Tree transformability: Automatic registration with the tree transformation system
       enables higher-order operations like JIT compilation.

    3. Static/dynamic field separation: Fields can be marked as static (excluded from
       transformations) or dynamic (included in transformations).

    4. Field conversion: Values can be automatically converted during initialization
       through field converters.

    5. Memory efficiency: Thread-safe caching with lifecycle management prevents
       memory leaks in long-running applications.

    Usage:

    ```python
    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from ember.core.registry.operator.base._module import EmberModule, ember_field, static_field

    @dataclass
    class MyModule(EmberModule):
        # Dynamic field - included in transformations
        weights: torch.Tensor = ember_field()

        # Static field - excluded from transformations
        config: Dict[str, float] = static_field(default_factory=dict)

        def __post_init__(self):
            if 'scale' not in self.config:
                self._init_field(field_name='config',
                                value={**self.config, 'scale': 1.0})

        def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
            return x @ self.weights * self.config['scale']
    ```

    Quick notes on performance character:

    - Initialization: O(n) where n is the number of fields
    - Flattening: O(1) with caching after first operation
    - Field access: O(1) native Python attribute access
    - Memory: Proportional to the number of fields + bounded cache size
