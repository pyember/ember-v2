Operator System: Core Computational Abstraction

The Operator system represents the fundamental computational unit in Ember's architecture.
It implements an Ember-specific approach to functional programming with strong typing, native input/output
validation, immutability guarantees, and composition patterns.

Architectural Philosophy:
- Pure Functions: Operators are stateless, deterministic transformations from input to output
- Strong Type Safety: Generic type parameters and Pydantic validation ensure `specification` correctness
- Composition First: Designed specifically for transparent composition at any scale
- Immutability: All operators are immutable after construction for thread safety
- Explicit Interface: Clear input/output contracts enforced through specifications

These design principles enable several powerful capabilities:
1. Reliable Composition: Operators can be composed without unexpected interactions
2. Safe Parallelization: Immutability guarantees make parallel execution safe
3. Automatic Validation: Input/output validation catches errors at interface boundaries
4. Transparent Transformation: Auto-registration enables higher-order transformations
5. Predictable Behavior: Deterministic execution simplifies testing and reasoning about things

The system intentionally separates specification (what inputs/outputs are valid) from
implementation (how computation occurs). This separation of concerns allows for
independent evolution of validation rules and computational logic.

Core Design Patterns:
- Template Method: Abstract forward() with concrete __call__() implementation
- Strategy: Operators implement different computational strategies with common interface
- Specification: Runtime validation with detailed error information
- Generic Programming: Type variables enable extensive compile-time checking

Quick note on relationship to FP/FaaS:
The Operator system draws inspiration from functional programming and serverless
architectures, treating computation as pure functions with explicit contracts.

        Implements the core computational logic of the operator.

        This abstract method represents the heart of the Template Method pattern,
        defining the customization point for concrete operator implementations.
        Subclasses must implement this method to provide their specific computational
        logic while inheriting the standardized validation and execution flow from
        the base class.

        The forward method is guaranteed to receive validated inputs that conform
        to the operator's input model specification, removing the need for defensive
        validation code within implementations. Similarly, the return value will be
        automatically validated against the output model specification, ensuring
        consistent interface contracts.

        Implementation Requirements:
        1. Must be stateless - no modification of instance variables
        2. Must be idempotent - repeated calls with same inputs yield same outputs
        3. Must not have side effects - computation only affects return value
        4. Must handle all input fields defined in specification.input_model
        5. Must return value conforming to specification.structured_output

        Optimizations:
        - forward() can assume inputs are valid (already validated by __call__)
        - Type conversions should happen here rather than in caller
        - Complex computations can be memoized (though instances should remain
          immutable)

        Args:
            inputs: Validated input data guaranteed to conform to the operator's
                  input model specification. Never null or invalid.

        Returns:
            The computation result, which will be automatically validated against
            the operator's output model specification before being returned to caller.

        Raises:
            NotImplementedError: Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses.

                and wrapped)

        Executes the operator with comprehensive validation and error handling.

        This method implements the Template Method pattern, providing a standardized
        execution flow surrounding the subclass-specific forward() implementation.
        It manages the complete lifecycle of an operator invocation:

        1. Input Resolution: Determines the input format and normalizes it
        2. Input Validation: Ensures inputs conform to the specification
        3. Computation: Delegates to forward() for the core logic
        4. Output Validation: Ensures results conform to the specification
        5. Error Handling: Catches and wraps all execution errors

        The design supports multiple invocation patterns for flexibility:

        A. Pre-validated model invocation:
           ```python
           model = MyInputModel(field1="value", field2=123)
           result = operator(inputs=model)
           ```

        B. Dictionary-based invocation with validation:
           ```python
           result = operator(inputs={"field1": "value", "field2": 123})
           ```

        C. Keyword argument invocation:
           ```python
           result = operator(field1="value", field2=123)
           ```

        This flexibility maintains type safety while accommodating different
        calling patterns, enabling both strongly-typed programming and
        convenient dynamic usage.

        Args:
            inputs: Either a pre-validated input model instance, or a dictionary
                  of values to be validated against the input model schema.
                  If None, kwargs will be used instead.
            **kwargs: Key-value pairs representing the input fields. Only used
                     when inputs parameter is None. Provides a more Pythonic
                     calling convention for simple cases.

        Returns:
            The validated computation result conforming to the output model
            specification. Type checking guarantees this will be an instance of OutputT.

        Raises:
            OperatorSpecificationNotDefinedError: If the operator class does not define

        Retrieves the operator's specification with runtime validation.

        This property accessor provides a safe, verified reference to the operator's
        specification, ensuring that all operations that depend on the specification
        will fail safely if it has not been properly defined. The implementation
        inspects the class hierarchy to find the concrete specification, checking
        that it has been correctly overridden by the subclass.

        The accessor implements defensive programming by:
        1. Looking up the specification in the concrete class's dictionary
        2. Verifying it is not None or the abstract base class definition
        3. Raising a descriptive error if the specification is missing or invalid

        This strict validation prevents subtle bugs that could occur if an operator
        was mistakenly defined without a proper specification.

        Technical Implementation Notes:
        - Uses type(self).__dict__ to inspect only the concrete class's attributes
        - Compares against Operator.__dict__ to check for proper override
        - Raises specific, descriptive exception for easy debugging
