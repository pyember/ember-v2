Type definitions for XCS (eXecution Control System) components.

This module provides type-safe definitions for XCS components,
including Graph, Plan, Task, and other execution-related types.

The type system follows these design principles:
1. All interfaces are explicitly defined with clear contracts
2. Type variance is handled appropriately for input/output types
3. Type parameters are clearly documented and consistently named
4. Runtime checkable protocols are provided for easier debugging
5. All collection types are precisely defined with appropriate bounds
