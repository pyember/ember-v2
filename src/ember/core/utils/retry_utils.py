"""
Resilient execution facilities with configurable retry policies.

This module provides a type-safe, composable framework for handling transient failures
through configurable retry strategies. It encapsulates backoff algorithms and retry
policies behind a clean interface, enabling resilient execution of arbitrary operations.

Key components:
- IRetryStrategy: Core abstraction for retry policy implementations
- ExponentialBackoffStrategy: Production-ready implementation using randomized exponential backoff
- run_with_backoff: Convenience function for common retry scenarios
