"""
Network of Operators (NON) Pattern Implementation

This module provides composable building blocks for LLM application patterns.
It wraps core operators with convenient, strongly-typed interfaces for common
LLM workflows like ensembles, majority voting, and verification.

Each wrapper maintains the immutability and functional approach of the underlying
system while offering simple, intuitive interfaces for application developers.

Example usage:
    ```python
    # Create an ensemble with 3 identical models
    ensemble = UniformEnsemble(
        num_units=3,
        model_name="openai:gpt-4o",
        temperature=1.0
    )

    # Create a judge to synthesize the outputs
    judge = JudgeSynthesis(model_name="claude-3-opus")

    # Combine them sequentially
    pipeline = Sequential(operators=[ensemble, judge])

    # Execute the pipeline
    result = pipeline(inputs={"query": "What is the future of AI?"})

    # Alternatively, create the same pipeline with compact notation
    pipeline = build_graph(["3:E:gpt-4o:1.0", "1:J:claude-3-opus:0.0"])
    ```

# 2) MostCommon Operator Wrapper
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


class MostCommon(Operator[MostCommonInputs, MostCommonAnswerSelectorOutputs]):
    """
    Statistical consensus aggregator implementing a majority-vote decision strategy.

    MostCommon implements a robust, non-parametric approach to ensemble aggregation
    based on frequency counting. This operator identifies the most frequently occurring
    response in a collection, making it ideal for ensemble decision-making without
    introducing additional model-based bias.

    The algorithm employs a sophisticated frequency analysis that:
    1. Identifies exact matches through string equality
    2. Counts occurrence frequencies across all responses
    3. Selects the most frequent response as the consensus answer
    4. Handles ties deterministically (first occurrence wins)

    This approach offers several key advantages:
    - Model-agnostic aggregation (no additional inference needed)
    - Deterministic behavior with consistent outputs
    - Low computational overhead for high-performance workflows
    - Transparent decision mechanisms for interpretability

    The implementation abides by functional programming principles:
    - Pure function semantics with no side effects
    - Immutability of both the operator and processed data
    - Explicit input/output contract without hidden state

    Use this operator as the final stage in ensemble pipelines when:
    - You need statistical robustness against model hallucinations
    - Deterministic aggregation is more important than nuanced synthesis
    - The responses are expected to contain a clear majority answer

    Example:

# 3) Judge Synthesis Operator Wrapper
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


class JudgeSynthesis(Operator[JudgeSynthesisInputs, JudgeSynthesisOutputs]):
    """
    Intelligent meta-reasoning engine for synthesizing multiple model responses.

    JudgeSynthesis represents a sophisticated approach to ensemble aggregation that
    leverages a "judge" LLM to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize multiple candidate
    responses. Unlike statistical approaches, this operator applies reasoning capabilities
    to generate a superior answer that may incorporate elements from multiple responses
    or provide novel insights that resolve conflicts between them.

    The synthesis process follows a principled methodology:
    1. Candidate analysis - Each response is individually evaluated for quality and relevance
    2. Comparative assessment - Responses are compared and contrasted to identify patterns
    3. Critical evaluation - Factual correctness and reasoning quality are assessed
    4. Reasoned synthesis - A new response is generated that represents the best integrated answer

    This approach implements a meta-learning paradigm where:
    - A higher-quality model can supervise and improve outputs from other models
    - Conflicting information across responses can be resolved through reasoning
    - The final answer can exceed the quality of any individual input response
    - The synthesis provides both a final answer and an explanation of the reasoning

    Implementation follows SOLID principles through:
    - Single Responsibility - Focused solely on response synthesis
    - Open/Closed - Extensible design with configurable model selection
    - Liskov Substitution - Properly typed interfaces enable seamless composition
    - Interface Segregation - Minimal, focused API for synthesis operations
    - Dependency Inversion - Configuration injected through constructor

    This pattern is ideal for mission-critical applications where:
    - Response quality and correctness are paramount concerns
    - You need reasoning-based aggregation rather than simple statistics
    - The task involves complex, nuanced judgments requiring critical thinking
    - A trace of meta-reasoning about the decision process is valuable

    Example:
        judge = JudgeSynthesis(model_name="anthropic:claude-3-opus")
        result = judge(inputs=JudgeSynthesisInputs(
            query="What is the impact of rising sea levels?",
            responses=[response1, response2, response3]
        ))

# 4) Verifier Operator Wrapper
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


class Verifier(Operator[VerifierInputs, VerifierOutputs]):
    """
    Autonomous verification and correction system for answer quality assurance.

    The Verifier operator implements a critical quality control mechanism for LLM outputs,
    functioning as an independent verification layer that scrutinizes candidate answers
    for correctness, completeness, and coherence. This pattern follows established
    software engineering principles of separation of concerns by isolating the verification
    process from answer generation.

    The verification process employs a structured methodology:
    1. Correctness assessment - Evaluates factual accuracy and logical consistency
    2. Error identification - Pinpoints specific issues in the candidate answer
    3. Detailed explanation - Provides comprehensive reasoning for the verdict
    4. Correction formulation - When errors are found, generates an improved answer

    This implementation offers several architectural advantages:
    - Decoupled verification logic from answer generation
    - Independent error detection and correction capabilities
    - Auditable decision process with explicit reasoning
    - Strong type safety with comprehensive validation

    The design follows robust software engineering principles:
    - Single Responsibility - Focused exclusively on verification and correction
    - Interface Segregation - Clean, minimal interface for verification operations
    - Dependency Inversion - Model configuration injected via constructor
    - Open for Extension - Easily extended for domain-specific verification

    Verification represents a crucial pattern for mission-critical applications where:
    - Answer correctness is paramount (e.g., medical, legal, or financial domains)
    - Independent quality control is required for regulatory compliance
    - Explainable AI principles must be followed with reasoning transparency
    - Automatic error correction capabilities provide fault tolerance

        verifier = Verifier(model_name="anthropic:claude-3-opus")
