"""High-performance thread-local context system for component discovery.

The Ember Context System provides a lightweight, zero-overhead approach 
to component discovery and dependency management with these core principles:

1. Thread isolation: Each thread maintains independent registries 
2. Zero-overhead access: Component lookups have minimal cost
3. Lazy initialization: Components are created only when needed
4. Self-registration: Components register themselves
5. Direct interaction: Components interact directly without indirection

This design eliminates circular dependencies, improves thread safety,
and enhances performance while significantly reducing complexity.

Typical usage:

    from ember.core.context.config import ConfigComponent
    from ember.core.context.model import ModelComponent
    from ember.core.context.data import DataComponent
    
    # Create core components
    config = ConfigComponent()
    model = ModelComponent()
    data = DataComponent()
    
    # Access components through their interfaces
    model_instance = model.get_model("anthropic:claude-3")
    
    # Use components directly
    result = model_instance.generate("Calculate 27*35")
