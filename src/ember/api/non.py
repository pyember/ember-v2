"""Network of Networks (NON) API for Ember.

This module provides a clean interface for working with the Network of Networks
pattern in Ember, offering composable building blocks for LLM application patterns.

Examples:
    # Creating a simple ensemble with a judge (regular API)
    from ember.api import non

    ensemble = non.UniformEnsemble(
        num_units=3,
        model_name="openai:gpt-4o",
        temperature=1.0
    )

    judge = non.JudgeSynthesis(model_name="anthropic:claude-3-opus")

    pipeline = non.Sequential(operators=[ensemble, judge])

    result = pipeline(inputs={"query": "What is the capital of France?"})

    # Creating the same pipeline with compact notation
    pipeline = non.build_graph([
        "3:E:gpt-4o:1.0",              # Ensemble with 3 GPT-4o instances
        "1:J:claude-3-opus:0.0"        # Judge using Claude with temp=0
    ])

    # Execute the same way as any operator
    result = pipeline(inputs={"query": "What is the capital of France?"})
