"""Simplified XCS API - Zero Configuration, Maximum Power.

The XCS (eXecution Coordination System) provides automatic optimization
for compound AI systems with just four essential functions:

- @jit: Zero-configuration optimization for any function or operator
- @trace: Execution analysis and debugging  
- vmap: Transform single-item functions to batch processors
- get_jit_stats: Performance metrics and insights

That's it. No strategies to choose, no modes to configure.
