"""Operators API for Ember.

This module provides a unified interface for creating, composing, and executing operators
in the Ember framework. Operators are the fundamental computational units in Ember,
allowing for type-safe composition of language model operations.

Examples:
    # Creating a basic operator
    from ember.api.operators import Operator, EmberModel, Field

    class QuestionInput(EmberModel):
        question: str = Field(..., description="Question to answer")

    class AnswerOutput(EmberModel):
        answer: str = Field(..., description="Response to the question")

    class QuestionAnswerer(Operator[QuestionInput, AnswerOutput]):
        def forward(self, inputs: QuestionInput) -> AnswerOutput:
            # Process the input using a language model
            response = self.model.generate(inputs.question)
            return AnswerOutput(answer=response)

    # Using ensemble operators
    from ember.api.operators import EnsembleOperator

    ensemble = EnsembleOperator(
        operators=[
            QuestionAnswerer(model="gpt-4"),
            QuestionAnswerer(model="claude-3")]
    )

    # Using selector operators
    from ember.api.operators import MostCommonAnswerSelector

    pipeline = MostCommonAnswerSelector(
        operator=ensemble
    )

    # Execute the pipeline
    result = pipeline(QuestionInput(question="What is machine learning?"))
    print(result.answer)
