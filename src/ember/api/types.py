"""Types API for Ember.

This module provides types used throughout the Ember API surface area.
It centralizes type definitions to ensure consistency and compatibility
across the codebase.

Examples:
    from ember.api.types import EmberModel

    class MyInputModel(EmberModel):
        text: str
        max_length: int = 100
