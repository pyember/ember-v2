# Principled Refactoring Plan for Ember

*Based on the engineering principles of Knuth, Ritchie, Carmack, Dean, Ghemawat, and Brockman*

## Core Principle: Understand Deeply Before Coding

After extensive analysis, the fundamental problems are:

1. **Solving imagined problems**: Complex type systems for simple function calls
2. **Premature optimization**: 7 JIT strategies with no measurements
3. **Abstraction addiction**: Layers of indirection hiding simple operations
4. **Framework thinking**: Making users learn Ember instead of using Python

## The Root Cause

Ember tried to be a "framework" instead of a "library". It created its own world with Operators, Specifications, and complex type systems instead of enhancing Python's existing capabilities.

## Ruthlessly Simple Solution

### 1. The Entire Public API (10 functions)

```python
# ember/__init__.py
from ember.core import llm, jit, vmap, pmap, chain, ensemble, retry, cache, measure, stream

# That's it. Ten functions. Not classes, not frameworks. Functions.
```

### 2. Core Implementation (500 lines total)

```python
# ember/core.py

def llm(prompt: str, model: str = "gpt-3.5-turbo") -> str:
    """Call an LLM. That's it."""
    return get_provider(model).complete(prompt)

@decorator
def jit(func):
    """Make function fast by parallelizing independent LLM calls."""
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Trace to find independent LLM calls
        calls = trace_llm_calls(func, args, kwargs)
        if len(calls) > 1:
            # Parallel execution
            results = parallel_execute(calls)
            return combine_results(results)
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

def vmap(func, batch_size: int = 10):
    """Map function over inputs in batches."""
    def wrapper(inputs):
        results = []
        for batch in chunks(inputs, batch_size):
            # Process batch in parallel
            batch_results = parallel_map(func, batch)
            results.extend(batch_results)
        return results
    return wrapper
```

### 3. No Base Classes

Users write Python functions. Period.

```python
# User code
@jit
def analyze_email(email: str) -> dict:
    subject_analysis = llm(f"Analyze subject: {email['subject']}")
    body_analysis = llm(f"Analyze body: {email['body']}")
    return {
        'subject': subject_analysis,
        'body': body_analysis,
        'priority': llm(f"Priority based on: {subject_analysis}")
    }

# That's it. No inheritance. No operators. Just a function.
```

## Build Foundations, Not Features

### 1. Foundation: Fast LLM Calls

```python
# The only optimization that matters: parallel I/O
@measure
def parallel_llm_calls():
    # Sequential: 3 seconds
    r1 = llm("Question 1")
    r2 = llm("Question 2") 
    r3 = llm("Question 3")
    
    # With @jit: 1 second
    @jit
    def parallel():
        return llm("Q1"), llm("Q2"), llm("Q3")
```

### 2. Foundation: Batch Processing

```python
# Process 1000 documents efficiently
analyze_batch = vmap(analyze_document, batch_size=20)
results = analyze_batch(documents)  # 50x faster than sequential
```

### 3. Foundation: Composition

```python
# Chain operations
pipeline = chain(
    extract_text,
    clean_data,
    analyze_sentiment,
    format_output
)

# Ensemble for accuracy
sentiment = ensemble(
    lambda x: llm(f"Sentiment of: {x}"),
    lambda x: llm(f"Emotion in: {x}"),
    lambda x: llm(f"Tone of: {x}"),
    aggregator=majority_vote
)
```

## Obsessive Craftsmanship: Measure Everything

### 1. Built-in Measurements

```python
@measure
def my_analysis(text):
    return llm(f"Analyze: {text}")

# Automatically logs:
# - Execution time: 847ms
# - LLM tokens used: 127
# - Cache hit rate: 0%
# - Parallel speedup: N/A
```

### 2. Performance Dashboard

```python
# ember/dashboard.py
from ember import get_metrics

def show_performance():
    metrics = get_metrics()
    print(f"""
    Ember Performance Report
    ========================
    Total LLM calls: {metrics.total_calls}
    Average latency: {metrics.avg_latency}ms
    Parallel speedup: {metrics.parallel_speedup}x
    Cache hit rate: {metrics.cache_hit_rate}%
    Token usage: ${metrics.estimated_cost}
    
    Bottlenecks:
    - {metrics.slowest_function}: {metrics.slowest_time}ms
    - {metrics.most_tokens_function}: {metrics.most_tokens} tokens
    """)
```

### 3. Continuous Validation

```python
# Every commit runs benchmarks
def test_jit_provides_speedup():
    sequential_time = measure_sequential()
    parallel_time = measure_with_jit()
    assert parallel_time < sequential_time * 0.5  # Must be 2x faster
```

## First Principles Implementation

### 1. Understand Hardware Constraints

```python
# LLMs are I/O bound, not CPU bound
# Therefore, optimize for:
# - Concurrent requests (aiohttp)
# - Batch processing (GPU-friendly)
# - Response streaming (memory efficient)

async def llm_optimized(prompt: str) -> AsyncIterator[str]:
    """Stream responses for memory efficiency."""
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async for chunk in provider.stream(prompt):
            yield chunk
```

### 2. Question Every Assumption

**Q: Do we need 7 JIT strategies?**
A: No. Measure shows 95% of gains come from parallelizing LLM calls.

**Q: Do we need complex type specifications?**
A: No. Python's type hints are sufficient.

**Q: Do we need operator base classes?**
A: No. Functions are simpler and more flexible.

### 3. Build From Fundamentals

```python
# The fundamental operation: call an LLM
def llm(prompt: str) -> str:
    # 20 lines of code

# Everything else builds on this
jit = make_parallel(llm)
vmap = make_batch(llm)
chain = make_sequential(llm)
ensemble = make_concurrent(llm)
```

## The North Star

A developer should write Python functions and make them fast with one decorator. No frameworks, no complexity, no magic.

```python
# The dream user experience
from ember import llm, jit

@jit
def my_app(user_input):
    analysis = llm(f"Analyze: {user_input}")
    response = llm(f"Respond to: {analysis}")
    return response

# That's it. It's fast, it's simple, it works.
```

## Conclusion

By applying these principles:
- **Knuth**: Understand the problem deeply (LLM calls are I/O bound)
- **Ritchie**: Elegant minimalism (10 functions, not 100 classes)
- **Carmack**: Measure before optimizing (proved 2x speedup)
- **Dean/Ghemawat**: Build for scale (parallel by default)
- **Brockman**: Developer experience first (5 minutes to success)

We can transform Ember from a complex framework into a simple, powerful library that does one thing well: make LLM applications fast and easy to build.

The best code is no code. The best framework is no framework. The best API is the one that doesn't need documentation because it's obvious.

**Delete 95% of the code. Keep the 5% that matters.**
