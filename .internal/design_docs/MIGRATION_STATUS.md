# Migration Status Report

## What We've Done

### Models Registry Migration ✅
1. **Renamed SimpleModelRegistry → ModelRegistry**
   - Updated class name and file name
   - Updated all imports in models.py
   - Updated ModelService to use new registry
   - Created new tests

2. **Fixed Protobuf Issue** ✅
   - Made DeepMind provider imports lazy
   - Handles protobuf errors gracefully

3. **Cleaned Up Old Code** ✅
   - Backed up old registry files
   - Removed ModelFactory references
   - Created clean architecture

## Major Discovery: Operator System Was Completely Redesigned

The codebase has undergone a major architectural change:
- Old: `ember.core.registry.operator` (class-based with inheritance)
- New: `ember.core.operators_v2` (protocol-based, functional)

### Files Still Using Old Operator System:
1. `src/ember/core/non.py` - Imports old EnsembleOperator, MostCommonAnswerSelectorOperator, etc.
2. Various other files expecting the old operator structure

## Current Blocker

The `non.py` file is trying to import operators that no longer exist in their old location:
```python
from ember.core.registry.operator.core.ensemble import EnsembleOperator
from ember.core.registry.operator.core.most_common import MostCommonAnswerSelectorOperator
# etc...
```

These classes were replaced with a simpler protocol-based system in `operators_v2`.

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Complete the Operator Migration
- Update non.py to use the new operators_v2 system
- This requires understanding the new operator design
- May require significant code changes

### Option 2: Restore Old Operator Files
- Check git history for the old operator files
- Restore them temporarily to unblock the models work
- Plan a separate migration for operators

### Option 3: Minimal Fix
- Create stub/compatibility operators that implement the old interface
- Use the new operators_v2 internally
- Allows gradual migration

## Models Registry Status

The models registry migration is technically complete, but blocked by the operator system changes. Once the operator imports are resolved, the models system should work correctly with:
- Clean ModelRegistry (no "Simple" prefix)
- Direct initialization (no complex factories)
- ~40% less code
