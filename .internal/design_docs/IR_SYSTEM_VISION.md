# IR System: The Critical Innovation

*Why the IR system is essential for Ember's future*

## The Vision

The IR (Intermediate Representation) system isn't just an optimization detail - it's the key to Ember's future as a distributed AI system.

## Why IR Matters

### 1. Cloud Scheduler Optimization
```python
# Today: Local execution
@jit
def complex_pipeline(x):
    a = expensive_model_1(x)
    b = expensive_model_2(x)  
    c = combine(a, b)
    return final_model(c)

# Tomorrow: Cloud-optimized execution
# The IR enables:
# - Parallel execution of model_1 and model_2 on different GPUs
# - Optimal placement based on model requirements
# - Cost optimization across providers
# - Automatic batching across users
```

### 2. Cross-Provider Optimization
```python
# The IR can see that these are independent
graph = Graph([
    Operation(OpType.LLM_CALL, model="gpt-4", ...),
    Operation(OpType.LLM_CALL, model="claude-3", ...),
    Operation(OpType.LLM_CALL, model="gemini", ...),
])

# Cloud scheduler can:
# - Route to different providers in parallel
# - Handle rate limits intelligently  
# - Optimize for cost vs latency
```

### 3. Future Capabilities

#### Automatic Caching
```python
# IR can identify deterministic subgraphs
# Cache results across users securely
```

#### Cost Prediction
```python
# IR enables cost estimation before execution
estimated_cost = graph.estimate_cost()
if estimated_cost > budget:
    graph = graph.optimize_for_cost(budget)
```

#### Execution Planning
```python
# Generate execution plans for different scenarios
plan_fast = graph.plan(optimize_for="latency")
plan_cheap = graph.plan(optimize_for="cost")
plan_balanced = graph.plan(optimize_for="balanced")
```

## Learning from Other Systems

### MLIR Philosophy
- Multiple levels of abstraction
- Progressive lowering
- Extensible operations

### Our Adaptation
- High-level operations (LLM_CALL, ENSEMBLE)
- LLM-specific optimizations (batching, caching)
- Cloud-native design (serializable, distributable)

## Design Principles

### 1. High-Level Operations
```python
class OpType(Enum):
    # Not low-level like ADD, MUL
    # But high-level, meaningful operations
    LLM_CALL = "llm_call"
    ENSEMBLE = "ensemble"
    TRANSFORM = "transform"
```

### 2. Optimization Metadata
```python
@dataclass
class Operation:
    # Not just what to do
    # But hints for how to do it efficiently
    estimated_cost: Optional[float]
    estimated_latency_ms: Optional[float]
    parallelizable: bool
    cacheable: bool
```

### 3. Cloud-First Design
```python
def to_cloud_format(self) -> Dict:
    """Serialize for cloud scheduler."""
    return {
        "version": "1.0",
        "operations": [...],
        "optimization_hints": {...},
        "security_context": {...}
    }
```

## The Payoff

### Near Term (3-6 months)
- Local optimization (batching, parallelization)
- Cost tracking and prediction
- Basic caching

### Medium Term (6-12 months)  
- Cloud scheduler integration
- Cross-user optimization
- Provider arbitrage

### Long Term (12+ months)
- Global optimization across workloads
- Automatic cost/latency tradeoffs
- New execution strategies we haven't imagined

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Clean IR design
- Basic operations
- Local optimizations

### Phase 2: Cloud Ready
- Serialization format
- Security contexts
- Optimization hints

### Phase 3: Cloud Native
- Scheduler protocol
- Distributed execution
- Global optimization

## Security & Multi-Tenancy Considerations

### What Carmack Would Insist On

1. **PII Redaction**
   ```python
   # Operations must declare sensitivity
   Operation(
       op_type=OpType.LLM_CALL,
       sensitivity=SensitivityLevel.CONTAINS_PII,
       redaction_policy="mask_emails_and_names"
   )
   ```

2. **Secure Caching**
   - Never cache across users without explicit opt-in
   - Hash inputs with user context for cache keys
   - Automatic cache invalidation on sensitivity changes

3. **Execution Isolation**
   - Each user's graph runs in isolation
   - No shared state between executions
   - Resource limits enforced per-user

4. **Audit Trail**
   ```python
   # Every operation logs for compliance
   Operation.audit_entry() -> AuditLog
   ```

## Phase 1 Implementation (Day 0)

### Minimal Files to Create
```
src/ember/ir/
  __init__.py      # Public exports
  ops.py           # OpType, Operation  
  graph.py         # Graph with optimize()
  builder.py       # GraphBuilder helper
```

### Minimal Working Example
```python
from ember.ir import OpType, Operation, Graph

# This must work on Day 0
op = Operation(
    op_type=OpType.LLM_CALL,
    inputs=["user_prompt"],
    outputs=["response"],
    attributes={"model": "gpt-4"}
)

graph = Graph([op])
optimized = graph.optimize()  # No-op is fine initially
serializable = graph.to_dict()  # For future cloud use
```

## The Bottom Line

The IR system is not premature optimization - it's the architectural foundation that enables Ember to evolve from a local library to a distributed AI platform.

As Dean & Ghemawat would say: "Design for 10x scale from day one."

As Carmack would add: "But make it secure from day zero."
