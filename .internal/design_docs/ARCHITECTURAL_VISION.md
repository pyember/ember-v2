# Ember Framework: Architectural Vision

*The path to a world-class LLM development framework*

## Core Insight

The fundamental insight of Ember is correct: **LLM operations are just function composition**. The framework's value lies in making this composition fast, reliable, and ergonomic without introducing framework complexity.

## Vision: Ember v1.0

### The Entire Framework in 10 Lines

```python
from ember import models, jit, vmap, chain, ensemble, retry

# 1. Write normal Python functions
def analyze(text: str) -> dict:
    return models("gpt-4", f"Analyze: {text}")

# 2. Make them fast
fast_analyze = jit(analyze)

# 3. Make them scale  
batch_analyze = vmap(analyze)

# 4. Make them reliable
safe_analyze = retry(analyze, max_attempts=3)

# 5. Compose them
pipeline = chain(preprocess, fast_analyze, postprocess)
```

That's it. No inheritance. No magic. No framework complexity.

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Functions Are The Primitive

Not classes. Not operators. Functions.

```python
# Bad: Framework thinking
class SentimentOperator(Operator[str, dict]):
    def execute(self, text: str) -> dict:
        return self._call_model(text)

# Good: Just a function
def sentiment(text: str) -> dict:
    return models("gpt-4", f"Sentiment: {text}")
```

### 2. Composition Over Configuration

Build complex behavior by composing simple functions, not by configuring complex objects.

```python
# Bad: Configuration explosion
operator = EnsembleOperator(
    operators=[op1, op2, op3],
    voting_strategy="weighted",
    weights=[0.5, 0.3, 0.2],
    fallback_strategy="majority",
    error_handling="continue",
    timeout=30,
    retry_config=RetryConfig(max_attempts=3)
)

# Good: Explicit composition
def weighted_ensemble(x, ops, weights):
    results = [op(x) for op in ops]
    return sum(r * w for r, w in zip(results, weights))

safe_ensemble = retry(
    timeout(weighted_ensemble, seconds=30),
    max_attempts=3
)
```

### 3. Performance Is Opt-In

Start simple. Optimize when needed.

```python
# Development: Just write the function
def process(items: List[str]) -> List[dict]:
    return [analyze(item) for item in items]

# Production: Add optimizations
fast_process = jit(vmap(analyze))
```

### 4. Explicit Over Magic

What you see is what happens. No metaclasses, no `__getattr__` tricks, no hidden behavior.

```python
# Bad: Magic attribute access
result = operator.gpt4.sentiment(text)  # What is this doing?

# Good: Explicit function call
result = models("gpt-4", f"Sentiment: {text}")
```

### 5. Type Safe But Not Type Obsessed

Types guide development but don't dominate it.

```python
# Good: Clear types that help
def chain(*funcs: Callable[[Any], Any]) -> Callable[[Any], Any]:
    def chained(x):
        for func in funcs:
            x = func(x)
        return x
    return chained

# Bad: Type gymnastics
T = TypeVar('T')
U = TypeVar('U') 
V = TypeVar('V')
Chain2 = Callable[[Callable[[T], U], Callable[[U], V]], Callable[[T], V]]
```

├── cache.py       # Result caching
└── metrics.py     # Performance tracking
```

### Layer 3: Providers

## The User Journey

### Day 1: First Success
```python
from ember import models

# Works immediately
result = models("gpt-4", "Hello, world!")
print(result.text)
```

### Week 1: Building Applications
```python
from ember import models, chain

# Natural composition
def extract_entities(text: str) -> list:
    return models("gpt-4", f"Extract entities: {text}").json()

def enrich_entities(entities: list) -> list:
    return [models("gpt-4", f"Enrich: {e}").json() for e in entities]

pipeline = chain(extract_entities, enrich_entities)
result = pipeline("Apple announced new products today")
```

### Month 1: Production Systems
```python
from ember import jit, vmap, retry, cache

# Production-ready with minimal changes
@cache(ttl=3600)
@retry(max_attempts=3)
@jit
def analyze_document(doc: str) -> dict:
    return models("gpt-4", f"Analyze: {doc}").json()

# Process many documents efficiently
batch_analyze = vmap(analyze_document, batch_size=10)
results = batch_analyze(documents)
```

## What We're NOT Building

### 1. Not Another Framework
- No base classes to inherit from
- No lifecycle methods to implement
- No framework-specific concepts to learn

### 2. Not Configuration Hell
- No YAML files
- No 50-parameter constructors  
- No XML-style configuration

### 3. Not Magic
- No runtime code generation
- No monkey patching
- No metaclass wizardry

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Simplify (Weeks 1-2)
- Delete legacy operator system
- Implement `@module` decorator
- Clean functional API

### Phase 2: Optimize (Weeks 3-4)
- Two JIT strategies (basic, advanced)
- Clean vmap implementation
- Smart scheduling

### Phase 3: Productionize (Weeks 5-6)
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance benchmarks
- Documentation

### Phase 4: Polish (Weeks 7-8)
- API freeze
- Migration tools
- Launch preparation

## Success Metrics

### Developer Experience
- Time to first success: < 5 minutes
- Lines of code for common tasks: < 10
- Concepts to learn: < 5

### Performance
- JIT speedup: > 2x for suitable workloads
- vmap efficiency: > 80% of theoretical max
- Overhead: < 1ms per operation

### Reliability
- Test coverage: > 95%
- API stability: No breaking changes in v1.x
- Error messages: Clear and actionable

## The North Star

A developer should be able to:
1. Install Ember
2. Write a Python function
3. Make it fast with `jit()`
4. Make it scale with `vmap()`
5. Make it reliable with `retry()`
6. Ship to production

No frameworks. No complexity. Just functions.

## Conclusion

Ember has the potential to be the definitive tool for LLM application development. By ruthlessly focusing on simplicity, eliminating framework complexity, and providing powerful composition primitives, we can create something that would make Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat proud: a tool that does one thing exceptionally well.

The framework is 90% of the way there. The final 10% is about having the courage to delete code, simplify APIs, and trust that developers want power through simplicity, not complexity.

**The best framework is no framework. The best API is just functions.**
