# Temporary Directory - Original Ember Backups

This directory contains backups of the original Ember codebase before our simplification efforts.

## Contents

- `ember-original/` - The original Ember code as it was at the start of our refactoring
- `old_ember/` - Another backup of the original code
- `core_evolution_analysis.md` - Analysis document of the core evolution

## Purpose

These backups are kept for:
1. Reference when implementing new features
2. Ensuring we don't lose important functionality
3. Comparison to measure our simplification progress
4. Potential rollback if needed

## Note

These directories should not be imported or used directly. They are purely for reference.
