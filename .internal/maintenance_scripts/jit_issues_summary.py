JIT ISSUES SUMMARY
================================================================================

1. ISSUE: The public XCS API uses natural_jit which doesn't accept mode parameters
   - The `jit` function in ember.xcs is actually `natural_jit` from natural_v2.py
   - natural_jit is a simple decorator that doesn't accept any parameters
   - It always uses AUTO mode internally
   - There's no way to force structural or enhanced mode through the public API

2. ISSUE: Graph API has changed - add_edge method doesn't exist
   - The Graph class now has 'add' instead of 'add_edge'
   - The structural strategy still tries to call graph.add_edge
   - Graph.add signature: (func: Callable, *, deps: List[str] = None) -> str

3. ISSUE: natural_jit adapter fails with Operator classes
   - The SmartAdapter doesn't properly handle Operator subclasses
   - It converts EmberModel inputs to dicts, losing type information
   - Error: "'dict' object has no attribute 'messages'"

4. ISSUE: natural_jit expects __name__ attribute on all callables
   - Operator instances don't have __name__ by default
   - Must manually add ensemble.__name__ = "ensemble" etc.

5. ISSUE: No ensemble parallelization is happening
   - The "auto" mode returns 0 results instantly (no actual execution)
   - The structural mode fails with Graph.add_edge error
   - The enhanced mode doesn't detect ensemble patterns
   - Result: Ensembles run sequentially, not in parallel

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. Fix the Graph API mismatch:
   - Update StructuralStrategy to use graph.add() instead of graph.add_edge()
   - Or add a compatibility method: Graph.add_edge = lambda self, a, b: self.add(b, deps=[a])

2. Fix the natural_jit adapter for Operators:
   - Update SmartAdapter to recognize Operator classes
   - Preserve EmberModel types during adaptation
   - Handle the forward() method signature properly

3. Add mode parameter support to natural_jit:
   - Allow users to specify compilation strategies
   - Or expose the internal core.jit function that accepts modes

4. Fix ensemble detection in strategies:
   - Ensure at least one strategy recognizes EnsembleOperator
   - Implement proper parallel execution for ensembles

5. Add better error messages:
   - When JIT fails, provide actionable guidance
   - Explain why certain optimizations weren't applied
