# Operator Docstring Review Summary

## Completed Reviews

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Documentation

1. **`src/ember/core/operators/base.py`**
   - Added comprehensive module docstring with design principles
   - Already had excellent class and method documentation
   - Includes multiple detailed examples
   - Follows Google L7+ standards

2. **`src/ember/api/operators.py`**
   - Upgraded module docstring to explain progressive disclosure design
   - Added clear examples for each complexity tier
   - Documented key functions and usage patterns
   - Added "See Also" references

3. **`src/ember/core/operators/composition.py`**
   - Enhanced module docstring with architectural overview
   - Added comprehensive documentation for `parallel()` function
   - Includes detailed examples and use cases
   - Fixed duplicate documentation issue

### üìã Documentation Standards Applied

All enhanced files now meet Google L7+ standards:
- **Module docstrings**: Explain purpose, design philosophy, and usage
- **Function docstrings**: Include Args, Returns, Raises, Examples sections
- **Class docstrings**: Comprehensive with attributes and multiple examples
- **Professional tone**: No emojis, clear technical writing
- **CLAUDE.md alignment**: Opinionated design, progressive disclosure

### üéØ Key Improvements

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Documentation mirrors the API design
   - Simple examples first
   - Advanced usage clearly separated
   - Experimental features noted

2. **Real-World Examples**: Every major function has practical examples
   - Not just syntax demos
   - Show actual use cases
   - Include expected outputs

3. **Cross-References**: Liberal use of "See Also" sections
   - Guide users to related functionality
   - Build mental model of the system
   - Reduce discovery friction

### üìù Remaining Files

Many operator files remain to be reviewed:
- Core operators: `advanced.py`, `concrete.py`, `ensemble.py`, etc.
- Validation: `validate.py`, `validate_improved.py`
- Capabilities: `capabilities.py`, `protocols.py`
- Examples and legacy code

### üí° Recommendations

1. **Prioritize Core Files**: Focus on files users interact with most
   - `ensemble.py`, `concrete.py` - commonly used operators
   - `validate.py` - validation functionality
   - `protocols.py` - operator contracts

2. **Standardize Examples**: Use consistent example patterns
   - Always show imports
   - Use realistic scenarios
   - Include error cases

3. **Document Design Decisions**: Explain "why" not just "what"
   - Why certain patterns are preferred
   - Trade-offs made in the design
   - Future extensibility considerations

## Conclusion

The operator documentation review is making good progress. The enhanced files now meet Google L7+ standards with comprehensive examples and clear explanations. The documentation supports progressive disclosure, making simple things simple while enabling advanced usage.
